# scaleway_object_bucket

Creates and manages Scaleway object storage buckets.
For more information, see [the documentation](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/object-storage-feature/).

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "scaleway_object_bucket" "some_bucket" {
  name = "some-unique-name"
  tags = {
    key = "value"
  }
}
```

### Using object lifecycle

```hcl
resource "scaleway_object_bucket" "main"{
  name = "mybuckectid"
  region = "fr-par"
  
  # This lifecycle configuration rule will make that all objects that got a filter key that start with (path1/) be transferred
  # from their default storage class (STANDARD, ONEZONE_IA) to GLACIER after 120 days counting 
  # from their creation and then 365 days after that they will be expired and deleted.
  lifecycle_rule {
      id      = "id1"
      prefix  = "path1/"
      enabled = true
  
      expiration {
        days = 365
      }
  
      transition {
        days          = 120
        storage_class = "GLACIER"
      }
  }
  
  # This lifecycle configuration rule specifies that all objects (identified by the key name prefix (path2/) in the rule)
  # from their creation and then 50 days after that they will be expired and deleted.
  lifecycle_rule {
      id      = "id2"
      prefix  = "path2/"
      enabled = true
  
      expiration {
        days = "50"
      }
  }
  
  # This lifecycle configuration rule remove any object with (path3/) prefix that match
  # with the tags one day after creation.
  lifecycle_rule {
      id      = "id3"
      prefix  = "path3/"
      enabled = false
  
      tags = {
        "tagKey"    = "tagValue"
        "terraform" = "hashicorp"
      }
  
      expiration {
        days = "1"
      }
  }
  
  # This lifecycle configuration rule specifies a tag-based filter (tag1/value1).
  # This rule directs Scaleway S3 to transition objects S3 Glacier class soon after creation.
  # It is also disable temporaly.
  lifecycle_rule {
      id      = "id4"
      enabled = true
      
      tags = {
        "tag1"    = "value1"
      }
      
      transition {
        days          = 0
        storage_class = "GLACIER"
      }
  }
 
  # This lifecycle configuration rule specifies with the AbortIncompleteMultipartUpload action to 
  # stop incomplete multipart uploads (identified by the key name prefix (path5/) in the rule)
  # if they aren't completed within a specified number of days after initiation.
  # Note: It's not recommended using prefix/ for AbortIncompleteMultipartUpload as any incomplete multipart upload will be billed
  lifecycle_rule {
      #  prefix  = "path5/"
      enabled = true
      abort_incomplete_multipart_upload_days = 30
  }
}
```

## Arguments Reference


The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) The name of the bucket.
* `tags` - (Optional) A list of tags (key / value) for the bucket.
* `acl` - (Optional)(Deprecated) The canned ACL you want to apply to the bucket.
* `region` - (Optional) The [region](https://developers.scaleway.com/en/quickstart/#region-definition) in which the bucket should be created.
* `versioning` - (Optional) A state of [versioning](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/Versioning.html) (documented below)
* `cors_rule` - (Optional) A rule of [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/cors.html) (documented below).
* `force_destroy` - (Optional) Enable deletion of objects in bucket before destroying, locked objects or under legal hold are also deleted and **not** recoverable

The `acl` attribute is deprecated. See [scaleway_object_bucket_acl](object_bucket_acl.md) resource documentation.
Please check the [canned ACL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/acl_overview.html#canned-acl) documentation for supported values.

The `CORS` object supports the following:

* `allowed_headers` (Optional) Specifies which headers are allowed.
* `allowed_methods` (Required) Specifies which methods are allowed. Can be `GET`, `PUT`, `POST`, `DELETE` or `HEAD`.
* `allowed_origins` (Required) Specifies which origins are allowed.
* `expose_headers` (Optional) Specifies expose header in the response.
* `max_age_seconds` (Optional) Specifies time in seconds that browser can cache the response for a preflight request.

The `lifecycle_rule` (Optional) object supports the following:

* `id` - (Optional) Unique identifier for the rule. Must be less than or equal to 255 characters in length.
* `prefix` - (Optional) Object key prefix identifying one or more objects to which the rule applies.
* `tags` - (Optional) Specifies object tags key and value.
* `enabled` - (Required) The element value can be either Enabled or Disabled. If a rule is disabled, Scaleway S3 doesn't perform any of the actions defined in the rule.

* `abort_incomplete_multipart_upload_days` (Optional) Specifies the number of days after initiating a multipart upload when the multipart upload must be completed.

    * ~> **Important:** It's not recommended using `prefix` for `AbortIncompleteMultipartUpload` as any incomplete multipart upload will be billed

* `expiration` - (Optional) Specifies a period in the object's expire (documented below).
* `transition` - (Optional) Specifies a period in the object's transitions (documented below).

At least one of `abort_incomplete_multipart_upload_days`, `expiration`, `transition` must be specified.

The `expiration` object supports the following

* `days` (Optional) Specifies the number of days after object creation when the specific rule action takes effect.

~> **Important:**  If versioning is enabled, this rule only deletes the current version of an object.

The `transition` object supports the following

* `days` (Optional) Specifies the number of days after object creation when the specific rule action takes effect.
* `storage_class` (Required) Specifies the Scaleway [storage class](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/storage/object/concepts/#storage-class) `STANDARD`, `GLACIER`, `ONEZONE_IA`  to which you want the object to transition.

~> **Important:**  `ONEZONE_IA` is only available in `fr-par` region. The storage class `GLACIER` is not available in `pl-waw` region.

The `versioning` object supports the following:

* `enabled` - (Optional) Enable versioning. Once you version-enable a bucket, it can never return to an unversioned state. You can, however, suspend versioning on that bucket.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all above arguments, the following attribute is exported:

* `id` - The unique name of the bucket.
* `endpoint` - The endpoint URL of the bucket
* `region` - The Scaleway region this bucket resides in.

## Import

Buckets can be imported using the `{region}/{bucketName}` identifier, e.g.

```bash
$ terraform import scaleway_object_bucket.some_bucket fr-par/some-bucket
```
