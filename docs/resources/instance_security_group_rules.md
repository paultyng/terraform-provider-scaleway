# scaleway_instance_security_group_rules

Creates and manages Scaleway Compute Instance security group rules. For more information, see [the documentation](https://developers.scaleway.com/en/products/instance/api/#security-groups-8d7f89).

This resource can be used to externalize rules from a `scaleway_instance_security_group` to solve circular dependency problems. When using this resource do not forget to set `external_rules = true` on the security group.

~> **Warning:** In order to guaranty rules order in a given security group only one scaleway_instance_security_group_rules is allowed per security group.

## Examples

### Basic

```hcl
resource scaleway_instance_security_group sg01 {
    external_rules = true
}

resource scaleway_instance_security_group_rules sgrs01 {
    security_group_id = scaleway_instance_security_group.sg01.id
    inbound_rule {
        action = "accept"
        port = 80
        ip_range = "0.0.0.0/0"
    }
}
```

## Arguments Reference

The following arguments are supported:

- `security_group_id` - (Required) The ID of the security group.

- `inbound_rule` - (Optional) A list of inbound rule to add to the security group. (Structure is documented below.)

## Attributes Reference

- `id` - The ID of the security group.
