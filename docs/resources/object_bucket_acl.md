# scaleway_object_bucket_acl

Creates and manages Scaleway object storage bucket ACL.
For more information, see [the documentation](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/storage/object/concepts/#access-control-list-(acl)).

-> **Note:** `terraform destroy`  does not delete the Object Bucket ACL but does remove the resource from Terraform state.

-> **Note:** [Account identifiers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/acct-identifiers.html) is not supported by scaleway.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "scaleway_object_bucket" "some_bucket" {
  name = "some-unique-name"
}

resource "scaleway_object_bucket_acl" "main" {
  bucket = scaleway_object_bucket.main.name
  acl = "private"
}
```

## Example with Grants

```hcl
resource "scaleway_object_bucket" "main" {
    name = "your-bucket"
}

resource "scaleway_object_bucket_acl" "main" {
    bucket = scaleway_object_bucket.main.name
    access_control_policy {
      grant {
        grantee {
            id   = "<project-id>:<project-id>"
            type = "CanonicalUser"
        }
        permission = "FULL_CONTROL"
      }
    
      grant {
        grantee {
          id   = "<project-id>"
          type = "CanonicalUser"
        }
        permission = "WRITE"
      }
    
      owner {
        id = "<project-id>"
      }
    }
}
```
