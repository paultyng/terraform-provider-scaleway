}

## Argument Reference

- `name` - (Required) The bucket name.
- `object_lock_enabled` - (Optional) Enable object lock on the bucket. Defaults to `false`. Updating this field will force creating a new bucket.
- `region` - (Defaults to [provider](../index.md#region) `region`) The [region](../guides/regions_and_zones.md#zones) in which the Object Storage exists.
- `project_id` - (Defaults to [provider](../index.md#project_id) `project_id`) The ID of the project the bucket is associated with.


## Attributes Reference

In addition to all above arguments, the following attribute is exported:

* `id` - The unique name of the bucket.

~> **Important:** Object buckets' IDs are [regional](../guides/regions_and_zones.md#resource-ids), which means they are of the form `{region}/{name}`, e.g. `fr-par/bucket-name`

* `endpoint` - The endpoint URL of the bucket
