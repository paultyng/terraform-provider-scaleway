  type  = "VC1M"

  volume {
    size_in_gb = 20
    type       = "l_ssd"

## Volume

You can attach additional volumes to your instance, which will share the lifetime
of your `scaleway_server` resource.

~> **Warning:** Using the `volume` attribute does not modify the System Volume provided default with every `scaleway_server` instance. Instead it adds additional volumes to the server instance.

~> **Warning:** Some instance types require an additional volume to work. This includes for example *START-1M* and *VC1M*. If you run into this issue add an additional volume of the specified size.

The `volume` mapping supports the following:

* `type` - (Required) The type of volume. Can be `"l_ssd"`
* `size_in_gb` - (Required) The size of the volume in gigabytes.


## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `id` - id of the new resource
* `private_ip` - private ip of the new resource
* `public_ip` - public ip of the new resource

## Import

Instances can be imported using the `id`, e.g.

```
$ terraform import scaleway_server.web 5faef9cd-ea9b-4a63-9171-9e26bec03dbc
```
